# YouTube Comment Scrapper
A Python-selenium scrapper made to access the comments on YouTube videos of a given link without any login and auto scroll which is first of its kind ;)

Using Selenium and Chromedriver I have tried to make a Youtube Comment Scrapper. Selenium is a portable framework for testing web applications. Selenium provides a playback tool for authoring functional tests without the need to learn a test scripting language

You need Selenium 
```script
pip install selenium
```
Then go on to youtube to get the video whose comments you want to automate.

Then think of how many times you need to scroll to get the required no. of comments
enter that to the no. of clicks and Boom ! youre ready to get the Comments.
Now this is all that you need to get the dataset of comments
