# YouTube Comment Scrapper
A Python-selenium scrapper made to access the comments on YouTube videos of a given link without any login and auto scroll which is first of its kind ;)

Using Selenium and Chromedriver I have tried to make a Youtube Comment Scrapper. Selenium is a portable framework for testing web applications. Selenium provides a playback tool for authoring functional tests without the need to learn a test scripting language

You need Selenium 
```script
pip install selenium
```
